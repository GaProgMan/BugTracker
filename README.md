## Description

This project is a .NET core implemented Web API for listing Bugs and assigning users to them. For a list of the project aims and whether they have been attained, see the [Project Aims](./ProjectAims.md) file.

It uses Entity Framework Core to communicate with a Sqlite database, which contains a record for each of the Discworld novels.

It has been released, as is, using an MIT licence. For more information on the MIT licence, please see either the `LICENSE` file in the root of the repository or see the tl;dr Legal page for [MIT](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license)

## Creating the Database

This will need to be perfored before running the application for the first time

1. Change to the Persistence directory (i.e. `bugTracker.Core/bugTracker.Core.Persistence`)

    `cd bugTracker.Core.Persistence`

1. Issue the Entity Framework command to update the database

    `dotnet ef database update`

    This will ensure that all migrations are used to create or alter the local database instance, ready for seeding (see `Seeding the Database`)

## Building and Running - Non docker

1. Change to the api directory (i.e. `bugTracker.Core/bugTracker.Core.Api`)

    `cd bugTracker.Core.Api`

1. Issue the `dotnet` restore command (this resolves all NuGet packages)

    `dotnet restore`

1. Issue the `dotnet` build command

    `dotnet build`

1. Issue the `dotnet` run command

    `dotnet run`

    This will start the Kestrel webserver, load the `bugTracker.Core.Api` application and tell you, via the terminal, what the url to access `bugTracker.Core` will be. Usually this will be `http://localhost:5000`, but it may be different based on your system configuration.

## Building and Running - docker

1. Ensure that you are in the root directory of the project
1. Run the following command `docker build . -t bug.tracker.api -f API.Dockerfile`
1. Once the build process has completed, run the following command: `docker run -d -p 8000:80 bug.tracker.api`

The project should be running on port 8000 of your local machine. Heading to `localhost:8000/swagger` should load the swagger API documentation

## Seeding the Database

There are a series of API endpoints related to clearing and seeding the database. These can be found at:

    /Database/DropData
    /Database/SeedData

These two commands (used in conjunction with each other) will drop all data from the database, then seed the database (respectively) from a series of JSON files that can be found in the `SeedData` directory.

`bugTracker.Core.API` has been designed so that the user can add as much data as they like via the JSON files.

## Testing

The unit test library (`bugTracker.Core.Tests`) currently does not run, due to an incompatibility with Xunit's dotnet cli and .NET Core SDK 2.1.5. However, you should be able to run them in a full IDE (i.e. Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider).
